                <i>'COVID fatigue' </i>
                 becomes a greater problem the longer the
                pandemic wears on. People are tired of being told to stay at
                home and social distance, and the fear factor has lost its edge,
                leading to decreased COVID compliance and increased spread.

              It crawls Twitter for current tweets, uses deep learning NLP to
              classify them, and builds a cute little map to visualize our data
              <br /><br />

            <h2>
              how it does it
            </h2>
            <p>
              This bad boy uses Tweepy to acquire tweets, AllenNLP + Pytorch for
              model training and deployment, Flask for backend, and
              CSS/HTML/Bootstrap/JS therein to deploy this website you're
              reading.

              We're all so sick if quarantining, so why not get it over with?
              This technology is not only useful to recognize where COVID
              compliance is low in order to put better measures in place, but
              could also be expanded to check security footage to see if people
              are wearing masks by training a new program to recognize masked
              vs. bare faces. Some may say surveillance state, others say
              practical public health, but either way it's a fun hack!
